            {"\n"}burrito finance was made to be a bare-bones tool to see
            roughly how much I spend per month. It is a simple app created for
            personal use - I had previously been jotting down expenses on a
            notes app but found this to be clunky and unhelpful. I'm sure a good
            solution already exists out there, but I thought it would be fun to
            make my own app.
            {"\n\n"}As always, I wanted to inject my own style into this one;
            even if it was just for personal use, I didn't want it to be a
            boring app. The fluid animations I included between screens helped
            with this.
