      {"\n"}I made this game as my submission for a 24-hour game jam hosted by a
      game development club at Purdue university. I made everything in the game,
      save the sfx and music. It won first place (of four projects), netting me
      a king-sized Kit Kat. I love Kit Kats, so I was pretty ecstatic.
      {"\n\n"}A couple months down the road, I took a some time to polish the
      game as well as add an endless mode and port it to mobile. I worked on
      optimizing mobile performance without having to reduce the quality of the
      game's graphics.
