      {"\n"}I made this game as my submission for a 24-hour game jam hosted by a
      game development club at Purdue university. The theme was very broad:
      "Halloween." I made everything in the game, save the sfx and music. It won
      first place (of four projects), netting me a king-sized Kit Kat. I love
      Kit Kats, so I was pretty ecstatic.
      {"\n\n"}A couple months down the road, I took a some time to polish the
      game as well as to add achievements and an endless mode before porting it
      to mobile. I tried my best to maintain the game's graphical fidelity while
      still handling well on mobile devices.
