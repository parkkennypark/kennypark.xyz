            {"\n"}This game was made for a game jam I hosted at Purdue. The
            theme was "Short on Time."
            {"\n\n"}I'm really proud of how this game came out - I managed to
            pull together a lot of cohesiveness in the styling and polish for
            such a short time-frame. I am definitely interested in exploring
            this game further in the future.
            {"\n\n"}Interestingly enough, the very first thing I did for this
            game was grab the VHS shader by pend00 on godotshaders.com. It was
            really from there that the rest of the game fell into place.
