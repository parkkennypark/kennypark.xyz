This is the full source code to my personal website.

Note that this was my first website built from scratch, so it likely isn't the most well-built thing ever. Regardless, I wanted to put it out there in case anyone was interested.

The biggest issue with the code is that the styling is all over the place since I went into this all blind. I probably could've gotten great use out of Tailwind CSS.
